# FastAI-Notes
Notes which I have taken in the Amazon FastAI course sessions. Written in Markdown to help me and hopefully other people learn.

Notes from each session of the FastAI course:

# How to contribute?

Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/simon-mcmahon/FastAI-Notes.git`, play around and make some notes in the session. Write them up in Markdown and then get in touch and I'll add you as a collaborator.
